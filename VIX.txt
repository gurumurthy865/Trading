Vix: Volatality index
VIX, is one of the most common barometers of market sentiment
For traders, the VIX not only represents a useful tool for assessing risk, but also the opportunity to capitalise on volatility itself.
It was the first benchmark to quantify market expectations of volatility. But the index is forward looking, which means that it only shows the implied volatility of the S&P 500 (SPX) for the next 30 days.

Higher volatality means, more panic in the market which means market goes down.
Note we have IV(implied volatality) for stock options. VIX is for index options only

VIX india:
Lets say in NSE website currently vix is showing as 20.79%
Annually --> 20.79% --> That means market can go 20% up or down annually
How you will calculate montly or weekly or daily?
Monthly --> root(12) ie. 3.46 --> 20.79/3.46 = 6.1%
Weekly  --> root(52 weeks) ie. 7.12 --> 20.79/7.12 = 2.87%
Daily   --> root(365) ie.19.1 --> 20.79/19.1 = 1.1%

what does this 1.1% mean?
This mean today if nifty opens at 15000, range between which it would trade is 14860 to 15636... calculation is 15000/(1.1*100) = 136
You can write both put and call options beyond this range and make profit or
you can trade based on this range bound instinct
